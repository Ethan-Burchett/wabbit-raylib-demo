### Getting started

- raylib is built in c and has all the dependencies built into it
- when setting up a project from scratch:
    - git clone this project: https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart
        - CD into build folder
        - run `./premake5.osx gmake2`
        - CD back into root
        - run `make`
        - this creates an executable in the `bin/Debug` folder
            - run `./name_of_your_game_executable`
